# Sinusoidal Oscillators

A sinusoidal oscillator is a repeating sine/cosine waveform.  It is the only
primitive oscillator that isn't a modified sawtooth wave.

## Property Parameters

None

## Sound Theory

All sounds are composed of a number of sine waves at different frequencies and
volumes.  Each of these sine waves are multiples of the original frequency, so
if the base frequency (the one you hear) is 440 HZ the next frequency is 880 HZ.
These frequencies are called harmonics.
